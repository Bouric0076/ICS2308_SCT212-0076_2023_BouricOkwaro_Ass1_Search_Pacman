SEARCH ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED
==============================

1. DEPTH FIRST SEARCH (DFS)
   - File: search.py, lines 65-95
   - Uses Stack data structure
   - Implements graph search with visited set
   - Returns path to goal state

2. BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS)
   - File: search.py, lines 97-127
   - Uses Queue data structure
   - Implements graph search with visited set
   - Returns optimal path to goal state

3. UNIFORM COST SEARCH (UCS)
   - File: search.py, lines 129-159
   - Uses PriorityQueue with cost-based priority
   - Implements graph search with visited set
   - Returns optimal path with minimum cost

4. A* SEARCH
   - File: search.py, lines 168-199
   - Uses PriorityQueue with cost + heuristic priority
   - Implements graph search with visited set
   - Returns optimal path using heuristic guidance

HEURISTIC FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED
================================

1. MANHATTAN HEURISTIC
   - File: searchAgents.py, lines 243-247
   - Calculates Manhattan distance between two points
   - Used for position-based search problems

2. EUCLIDEAN HEURISTIC
   - File: searchAgents.py, lines 249-253
   - Calculates Euclidean distance between two points
   - Alternative heuristic for position-based problems

3. CORNERS HEURISTIC
   - File: searchAgents.py, lines 349-368
   - Calculates maximum Manhattan distance to remaining corners
   - Used for CornersProblem

4. FOOD HEURISTIC
   - File: searchAgents.py, lines 449-473
   - Calculates maximum of farthest food distance and average distance
   - Enhanced heuristic for FoodSearchProblem

AGENTS IMPLEMENTED
===================

1. SearchAgent
   - Generic search agent that can use any search function
   - Configurable with different search problems and heuristics

2. AStarCornersAgent
   - Uses A* search with cornersHeuristic
   - Solves corner-finding problems efficiently

3. AStarFoodSearchAgent
   - Uses A* search with foodHeuristic
   - Solves food collection problems efficiently

4. ClosestDotSearchAgent
   - Greedy agent that finds closest food at each step
   - Uses findPathToClosestDot function
